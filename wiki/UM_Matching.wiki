#summary Finding matching scans between two data sets.

= Introduction =

RadPy has the ability to look within a set of 1D scans and find scans which match the currently plotting scan according to a set of user specified criteria.  It can also extract a matching 1D profile from a 3D Dicom-RT Dose 
data set.

= Finding Matching Profiles =

To find the scans in a reference data set that match a particular scan, first load the scan and plot it in the RadPy plot window.  Open your reference data set and right click on a branch in the Tree View.  (RadPy will only look for scans under the branch you choose.)  Choose 'Add matching beams'.  This will pull up the 'Parameters to match' dialog.
