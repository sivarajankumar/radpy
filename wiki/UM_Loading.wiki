#summary How to load beam data into RadPy.

= Introduction =

RadPy currently can read beam data in RFB, Dicom or BDML formats.

= Opening a file=

To open an RFB file, click on the Open File button on the Toolbar or on the Open File option in the File Menu.  This will open a file dialog (set by default to open in the /Data directory in the RadPy installation folder).  Files with the extensions .rfb, .dcm or .xml will be shown.  Click on the desired file.

The profiles contained within the file will show up in a tree structure in the Tree View window to the right.

Each profile will be grouped within the tree by the following parameters (in descending order): file name, machine, energy, wedge type and field size.  If another file is opened, those scans will appear in a new tree under that file name.

==RFB==

In order to be able to read the data in an RFB file, the file must only contain inplane, crossplane and depth dose profiles for either electrons or photons.  Any TMR, absolute dose, 2D image, point-to-point scan, diagonal scan or any other data the file contains will prevent RadPy from reading it.
